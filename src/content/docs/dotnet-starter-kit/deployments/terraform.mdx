## Pre-Requisites

<Steps>
1. Install Terraform on your machine
    If you are on Windows, use Chocolatey to install Terraform via the following CLI command.

    ```
    choco install terraform
    ```

2. Once Terraform is installed, make sure that you machine is configured to authenticate into AWS. Please refer to [this article](https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/aws-credentials-for-dotnet-applications/#install-aws-cli). With that done, you are good to go!
</Steps>

## Bootstrapping

If you are deploying the `FSH .NET Starter Kit` for the first time, navigate to `./terraform/boostrap` and run the following commands,

```terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

This will provision the required backend resources on AWS that terraform would need in the next steps. Basics this will create an Amazon S3 Bucket, and DynamoDB Table.

## Deploy

Navigate to `./environments/dev/` and run the following.

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

This will deploy the following,

- ECS Clusters and Tasks. (.NET Web API & Blazor)
- RDS PostgreSQL Database Instance.
- Required Networking Components like VPC, ALB etc.

## Destroy

Once you are done with your testing, ensure that you delete the resources to keep your bill under control.

terraform destroy --auto-approve
