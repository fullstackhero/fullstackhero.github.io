## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have the following configured / setup on your development machine. 

- .NET 8 SDK installed.
- Visual Studio IDE.
- Docker Desktop. (*required only if you need the Aspire Dashboard running.*)
- PostgreSQL instance running on your machine or docker container.

For more details, please refer to the [Development Environment Guide](/dotnet-starter-kit/general/development-environment/).

## Quick Start Guide

To get started with this starter kit, here are the available options.

1. Install the NuGet .NET CLI Template.
2. Fork the Repository. Use this if you want to always keep your version of the StarterKit up-to date with the latest changes.


### FSH .NET CLI Template

FullStackHero .NET StarterKit is built to have seamless & developer friendly experience. To build your new .NET project based on this template, the recommended way is to install the .NET template package on your machine.

Install the template by running the following command.

```
dotnet new install FullStackHero.NET.StarterKit
```

> To get the latest version of the package, visit [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FullStackHero.NET.StarterKit/). This Starter Kit is now in release candidate stage.

### Forking the Repository

Please follow the below instructions.

1. Fork this repository to your local.
2. Open up the `./src/FSH.Starter.sln`.
3. This would up the FSH Starter solution which has 3 main components.
   1. Aspire Dashboard (set as the default project)
   2. Web API
   3. Blazor
4. Now we will have to set the connection string for the API. Navigate to `./src/api/server/appsettings.Development.json` and change the `ConnectionString` under `DatabaseOptions`. Save it. Currently the supported database instances are `postgresql` and `mssql`.
5. Ensure that you have docker desktop up and running. If you want to skip the Docker part, you will have to make the default startup project as the `Server` and `Client` project.
6. Once that is done, run the application via Visual Studio, with Aspire as the default project. This will open up Aspire Dashboard at `https://localhost:7200/`.
7. API will be running at `https://localhost:7000/swagger/index.html`.
8. Blazor will be running at `https://localhost:7100/`.
