## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have the following configured / setup on your development machine. 

- .NET 8 SDK installed.
- Visual Studio IDE.
- Docker Desktop. (*required only if you need the Aspire Dashboard running.*)
- PostgreSQL instance running on your machine or docker container.

For more details, please refer to the [Development Environment Guide](/dotnet-starter-kit/general/development-environment/).

## Quick Start Guide

To get started with this starter kit, here are the available options.

1. Install the NuGet .NET CLI Template.
2. Fork the Repository. (*Use this if you want to always keep your version of the StarterKit up-to date with the latest changes.*)


### FSH .NET CLI Template

FullStackHero .NET StarterKit is built to have seamless & developer friendly experience. To build your new .NET project based on this template, the recommended way is to install the .NET template package on your machine.

Install the template by running the following command.

```
dotnet new install FullStackHero.NET.StarterKit
```

> To get the latest version of the package, visit [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FullStackHero.NET.StarterKit/). This Starter Kit is now in release candidate stage.

Once the package is installed, you can create a new instance of the project by running,

```
dotnet new fsh -o Starter
```

Here, your new solution name would be `Starter`.

This would generate your new solution and also ensures that all the required packages are resolved for you.

### Forking the Repository

You would probably need to take this approach if you want to keep your source code upto date with the latest changes. To get started based on this repository, you need to get a copy locally.

- Make a fork of fullstackhero‚Äôs dotnet-starter-kit repository in your Github account.
- Next, since you need to start your private personal project, create your new dotnet-starter-kit personal project by cloning the forked repository on your personal github. This could be done as simple as running `git clone https://github.com/{yourgithubuseraccount}/dotnet-starter-kit.git` locally on your development machine.
- Setup an upstream remote on your personal project pointing to your forked repository using command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/{yourgithubuseraccount}/dotnet-starter-kit` and `git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE`

Now, whenever there is a new update on fullstackhero‚Äôs dotnet-starter-kit repository, you could simply pull in the latest change on your private fork of the fullstackhero‚Äôs dotnet-starter-kit repository and later merge these changes with you personal projects.

## Your First .NET Starter Kit Solution!

<Steps>
1. Open up the `./src/FSH.Starter.sln`.

2. This would up the FSH Starter solution which has 3 main components.
   
   1. Aspire Dashboard (set as the default project)
   2. Web API
   3. Blazor

3. Now we will have to set the connection string for the API. Navigate to `./src/api/server/appsettings.Development.json` and change the `ConnectionString` under `DatabaseOptions`. Save it. Currently the supported database instances are `postgresql` and `mssql`. By default you can find a PostgreSQL configuration within the `appsettings.Development.json` file. 
    1. For PostgreSQL,
        ``` json
        "DatabaseOptions": {
            "Provider": "postgresql",
            "ConnectionString": "Server=192.168.1.110;Database=fullstackherodb;User Id=postgres;Password=password"
        },
        ```
    2. For MSSQL,

        ``` json
        "DatabaseOptions": {
            "Provider": "mssql",
            "ConnectionString": "Server=192.168.1.104;Database=rootDb;User Id=sa;Password=Password1*;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
        },
        ```

4. Ensure that you have docker desktop up and running. If you want to skip the Docker part, you will have to make the default startup project as the `Server` and `Client` project.

5. Once that is done, run the application. 

6. Aspire Dashboard will be running at `https://localhost:7200/`.

7. API will be running at `https://localhost:7000/swagger/index.html`.

8. Blazor will be running at `https://localhost:7100/`.
</Steps>

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Solution Structure

## üì¨ Service Endpoints

> todo : can someone update this? Simple run the API and add the route details referring to Swagger.

| Endpoint | Method | Description      |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| `/token` | POST   | Generates Token. |

## How to Run?

### üß™ Standalone

### üê≥ Docker Support

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to AWS

## ü§ù Contributing

## üìù Migrations

<Steps>
1. Run `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`
2. Navigate to `./api/server` and run the following EF CLI commands.

    ```bash
    dotnet ef migrations add "Add Identity Schema" --project .././migrations/postgresql/ --context IdentityDbContext -o Identity
    dotnet ef migrations add "Add Tenant Schema" --project .././migrations/postgresql/ --context TenantDbContext -o Tenant
    dotnet ef migrations add "Add Todo Schema" --project .././migrations/postgresql/ --context TodoDbContext -o Todo
    dotnet ef migrations add "Add Catalog Schema" --project .././migrations/postgresql/ --context CatalogDbContext -o Catalog
    ```
</Steps>
